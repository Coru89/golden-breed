            "accordion_content": "Honestly, most surf clothing brands like Deus Ex Machina, Ozmosis, Howler Brothers and Rip Curl, all make an effort due to their values and love of nature, but to our knowledge, there's no clear winner of which company manufacturers the most eco-friendly surfwear on the planet. One thing to look for is where the garments are made. Golden Breed partners with a small Bali manufacture, and we know this makes a tremendous impact on jobs in the local community."

            "accordion_content": "Golden Breed was originally a global surf brand, established way back in 1969. It marks the glory days when life was simple, people were free and surf culture was all about the love of single finned cross stepping. We honour this era in our clothing with a touch of retro in every item we make. We're unique in the surf industry and fashion brands, with a clothing line that stays current and doesn't date quickly."

            "accordion_content": "There's no denying it, they're some of the best surf brands out there, pumping out some of the best surf gear, but Golden Breed surf accessories and clothing comes with the nostalgia of the good old days, chilled vibes & salty memories. We're not one of the massive commercial major surf brands. We're a niche Australian, iconic surf label that's true to its roots and has honoured mother nature since 1969."
